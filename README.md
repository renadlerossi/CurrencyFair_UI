# Hi Currency Fair,
<br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show my skills on this test.

<h3>A few things that I would like to explain about my code</h3>

On your live website, the currency rates, flags and symbols, returns from an API.
I’ve populate those variables dynamically in a similar way to what I believe the API is returning. I did that so I could show some of my JavaScript skills and to make the UI more functional (as stated in the challenge prospect).

A few turn arounds were required as I wanted to use just raw JavaScript. In a real situation, I believe we would be using a more “reacting” framework such as Angular and ReactJS, making easier to access and print variables updates in the view.

Would be great if you could give some feedback, as I enjoyed to do this challenge.
